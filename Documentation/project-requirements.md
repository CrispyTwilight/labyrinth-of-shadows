# Project Requirements

**Team:** Christian, CAB, Will, Hunter, John<br>
**Courses:** ILCC CIS-125-E100 Intro to Programming Logic and ILCC CIS-161-E100 C++

For your final projects you will be working in your groups to complete the following task:<br>
Create a game.

The description of the task is intentionally ambiguous to give you freedom to show me what you are capable of.

Some requirements:
- You must use objects. For each member of your group you must contribute at least 3 super-classes, 5 sub-classes, and 2 structures. Be sure to label each class appropriately so I can attribute them to the proper individual.
- All classes must include fields and methods.
- You must implement a file-based saving system.
- The user experience must be high level. It must feel good/enjoyable to play.
- Those are the only hard requirements. If anyone edits someone else's work, ensure that it is properly referenced.
